Simple Furniture Webpage design using HTML and CSS.
This is my very first Webpage done using HTML and CSS, related to furniture.

I have used the colour of the main picture to the main blocks and testimonials, so that the page gives Minimalist look. And added shadows to some blocks to give a pop-up look and also increases the visual effect to the users.
